Create a contact form like shown in the mockup below.

1. make all fields required
1. experiment with different styles for separate input states (you don't have to use them all, just make sure it's clear how they work):
   1. :enabled
   1. :focus
   1. :valid
   1. :invalid
1. use a custom style for the radio buttons as shown in the second picture
